#
# Fish script to run ssh-agent correctly, i.e. only start a new one when
# necessary. Drop it into ~/.config/fish/conf.d and forget about it.
#
# Uses ps and kill, everything else is done inside fish.
#
# Requires fish 2.3 for the string manipulation.
#
# Works with Fedora 26 and CentOS 7, for CentOS 6 you'll need a third party
# repo for fish anyway so make sure it's recent enough.
